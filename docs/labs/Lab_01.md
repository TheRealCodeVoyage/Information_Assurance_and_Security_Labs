# ACIT 4630 â€“ Lab 1 â€“ Setup Kali Linux and Metasplotable 2

**Note:**
You may optionally work with a partner for the labs in this course. Make sure you submit your **own-written** report of your lab, since the lab submission is **individual**.

## Download VirtualBox Software

- ðŸ‘‰ [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Prepare your VirtualBox Environment

### Create a Virtual Network type NAT

1. Initially we need to make sure our VirtualBox is on Expert mode! This could be changed either on the welcome page (the first page that appears) or in preferences, could be toggled from top tabs.

2. After swithed on expert mode, click on the tools options:

3. Follow the steps 1 and 2 to create a NAT Network

    ![alt text](../images/lab1-fig2.png)

    3. In step 3, you can double click on the NAT created to modify if needed.
    4. Feel free to rename your NAT to `IASNetwork`
    5. Here we can change the range of clients and sub-network we can later create which we do not change as of now.
    6. **Important!** make sure DHCP is checked/enabled!

## Install Kali Linux

**Kali Linux** is an advanced penetration testing Linux distribution that comes with lots of security tools preinstalled.

### Instructions
Download a VM image for Kali Linux and set up a VM machine for it [https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)

**Note:** If download speed is low, feel free to download via torrent, don't worry it is legal! ðŸ˜Ž

- After Extracting the compressed file, from the top menu in VirtualBox, choose Machine -> Add, then search for where you have extracted your Kali machine and choose the `.vbox` file.
- **important!** Before you start the Kali machine for the first time we need to make sure that its network is set on the NAT we previously created.
- To change the Network settings of our virtual machine (Kali) we need to hit Settings.

- From the left panel choose Network, Click on *Attached to:* drop down menu and choose **NAT Network**

    ![alt text](../images/lab1-fig4.png)

- Choose the custom NAT you just created above. `IASNetwork`
- Login to the VM. username: `kali` password: `kali`

## Post Kali Installation

- Open the Termianl and Change your Kali machine's hostname to a name unique to you:

```sh
hostnamectl hostname for-example-iman-a
```

Also you should replace the exact same name which you just chose as your hostname in `/etc/hosts` file with `kali`

```sh
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

```plaintext
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       for-example-iman-a
```

### First App to discover: Metasploit

Find Metasploit [(Doc page)](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/introduction/) and run it from the Applications menu. You should see `msfconsole` open. Almost all of your interaction with Metasploit will be through its many modules, which we explore more next week.

## Install Metasploitable 2 Virtual Machine

**Metasploitable 2**, is an intentionally vulnerable Ubuntu (64-bit) Linux virtual machine that is designed for testing common vulnerabilities.

- Download a VM image for metasploitable 2 and set up a VM machine for it
- [https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/)

### [Important for Mac Users] => If you have a Mac which has M series Chip:

**If you don't have a Mac with M Series Chip, you should skip this section and start from Metasploitable 2 Installation**

since you CPU architecture is different (arm64) in compare to others (which most probably is amd64) you need to convert this virtual machine's file to work on your CPU architecure. Here is how:

1. Download and Install the HomeBrew
2. InstallQEMU

    ```sh
    brew install qemu
    ```

3. Convert the .vdmk file to .QCOW2 (QEMU Image)

    ```sh
    qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 vmName.vmdk vmName.qcow2
    ```

4. Load the .QCOW2 file to UTM App

Note for Windows 11 Users using VirtualBox:

- You might face a Kernel Panic with Metasploitable 2; here are steps for workaround:
  - Turn of the MetaSploitable 2 VM machine
  - Run below commands in the PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    vboxmanage modifyvm <uuid|vmname> --acpi off
    vboxmanage modifyvm <uuid|vmname> --ioapic off
    ```

---

### Metasploitable 2 Installation

This is installation might be a little tricky! but don't worry i got you covered. if we take a look inside the .zip file, we will see bunch of files. the most important one that we need to work with is `Metasploitable.vmdk`. `.vmdk` file is a Virtual Disk, meaning the metasploitable VM is already installed on it we just need to attach it and boot it up. here is how:

1. In our VirtualBox instead of clicking on Add we will press **New**. we can also do so from the top menu => Machine => New.
2. Choose a name for your VM. It's recommanded that you choose the same decompressed directory which includes `.vmdk` file. Choose the Type to be Linux and Subtype to be Other Linux.

    ![alt text](../images/lab1-fig5.png)

3. We will jump to the last section *Hard Disk*. Since we have the Disk ready we just need to find it and attach it to this VM instance that we are creating.

    ![alt text](../images/lab1-fig6.png)

4. Click on Add button to find and add the disk we talked about (`.vdmk` file). It will be added into *Not Attached* section at first. You need to select it and press *Choose*.

    ![alt text](../images/lab1-fig7.png)

5. Again we need to make sure the NAT is configured correctly. You need to configure it using the Metasploitable VM's Setting similar to how we configred in Kali VM.
6. Now, You can launch the Metasploitable VM and log into it.
7. Login to the VM. username: `msfadmin`, password: `msfadmin`

### NMAP -  A Reconnaissance Tool

Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon. Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

- [Introduction to NMAP for Beginners! (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/NYgDzO8iQJ0?si=NcbmoceDVjTYUAM8)

- (Q4) What's the use case when we need to use `-Pn` probing option with nmap?
  - Hint: try `nmap google.com`
    - The server is live on the internet, and ready for you to probe even though running above command might tell you differently.

### Write-Up

#### When screenshoting a command, make sure texts are clear and your hostname we changed earlier is shown

Briefly Explain how you get to answer of questions below and include screenshots:

- Q1: Find your Kali's and Metasploitable's IP Addresses.
  - Note: If you're getting the same IP as the Kali Linux machine you need to change the network to a NAT network
- Q2: Using NMAP Cheatsheet above try to scan the **Metasploitable VM's** services and their software versions running on open ports. We will operate this recon from our Kali machine.
  - Hint: If you cannot see any port open on this machine from the Kali machine double-check the NAT network
  - Please explain which command's flag you used and why?
- Q3: What's the use case and when we need to use `-Pn` probing option with nmap?
