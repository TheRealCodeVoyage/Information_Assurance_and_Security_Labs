## 1. Choose Your Virtualization Software

You will run two virtual machines (VMs): **Kali Linux** (attacker) and **Metasploitable 2** (target).
Which software you use depends on your computer:

* **Windows / Linux / Intel-based macOS:** Use **VirtualBox**

    üëâ [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

* **Mac with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):** Use **UTM**

  üëâ [Download UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)

  ‚ö†Ô∏è VirtualBox does **not** work with Apple Silicon.

---

## 2. Setting Up the Network

Both Kali and Metasploitable **must be** on the same virtual network so they can communicate.

### VirtualBox (Intel/AMD users)

1. Open VirtualBox ‚Üí **Preferences** ‚Üí **Network** ‚Üí Switch to **Expert Mode**.

2. Create a **NAT Network**:

   * Name it `IASNetwork`
   * Make sure **DHCP is enabled**
   * Leave the default IP range unchanged

   ![alt text](../images/lab1-fig2.png)

3. Each VM must use this `IASNetwork` as its adapter. (You‚Äôll set this when configuring each VM below.)

---

### UTM (Apple Silicon users)

1. After setting up each VM, **Edit** each VM ‚Üí **Devices** ‚Üí **Networks**
2. Set the **Network Mode** on **Shared Network** (similar to NAT in VirtualBox).
3. Check **Show Advanced Settings**, Set the **Guest Network** to `10.0.2.0/24`
    ![UTM Network Setting](../images/lab1_fig2.2.png)
4. For **Emulated Network Card**, it shouldn't matter which Network Card you choose, but for consistancy choose one Network Card for both VMs.
5. Ensure **both Kali and Metasploitable VMs are attached to the same Shared Network**.

---

## 3. Install Kali Linux

### VirtualBox (Intel/AMD users)

>**Kali Linux** is an advanced penetration testing Linux distribution that comes with lots of security tools preinstalled.

1. Download a Kali VM image (prebuilt `.vbox`)

    üëâ [Kali Virtual Machines](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)

 - **Note:** If download speed is low, feel free to download via torrent, don't worry it is legal! üòé

2. In VirtualBox ‚Üí **Machine ‚Üí Add** ‚Üí select the extracted `.vbox` file.
3. In **Settings** ‚Üí **Network**, attach it to **`IASNetwork`**.
    ![alt text](../images/lab1-fig4.png)
4. Start the VM. Default login:
```plaintext
username: kali
password: kali
```

---

### UTM (Apple Silicon users)

‚ö†Ô∏è Prebuilt Kali VM images **do not work on Apple Silicon**.
You must install Kali manually.

1. Download the **ARM64 installer ISO**:
   üëâ [Kali Linux ARM64 Installer](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-bare-metal)
2. In UTM ‚Üí Create a new VM:

   * Select **Virtualize ‚Üí Linux**
   * Use the downloaded ARM64 ISO
   * Allocate at least **2 CPU cores** and **4 GB RAM**
   * Attach to the `IASNetwork` you created
3. Fixing the black screen issue:

   * Go to the VM‚Äôs **Settings** by hitting **Edit** ‚Üí **Devices**
   * Add a **Serial** device
   * Leave the Mode set to **Built-in Terminal**
   * Save settings and start the VM again

4. Boot and follow the installer prompts.

   * Set your own username/password.

---

## Post Kali Installation

- Open the Termianl and Change your Kali machine's hostname to a name unique to you:

```sh
hostnamectl hostname for-example-iman-a
```

Also you should **replace** the exact same name which you just chose as your hostname in `/etc/hosts` file with **`kali`**

```sh
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

```plaintext
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       for-example-iman-a
```

### First App to discover: Metasploit

Find Metasploit [(Doc page)](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/introduction/) and run it from the Applications menu. You should see `msfconsole` open. Almost all of your interaction with Metasploit will be through its many modules, which we explore more next week.

## Install Metasploitable 2 Virtual Machine

>**Metasploitable 2**, is an intentionally vulnerable Ubuntu (64-bit) Linux virtual machine that is designed for testing common vulnerabilities.

Download a VM image for metasploitable 2 and set up a VM machine for it

üëâ [Download Metasplotable 2 VM](https://bcit365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/iman_anooshehpour_bcit_ca/EY4Bw_6nCs5Jv4-rsNCy2JQBqfJSNn5_hEr-zGPwceQQqg?e=XANe8I)

### Install Metasploitable 2 (on UTM | Apple Silicon users)

**If you don't have a Mac with M Series Chip, you should skip this section and start from Metasploitable 2 Installation**

First we need to convert the Image Disk format from `.vmdk` which is readable by VirtualBox to `.qcow2` which is readable by UTM. In order to do this we need to follow the instruction below:

1. Download and Install the üëâ [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. Install QEMU (Optional: Learn more about [QEMU Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU))

    ```sh
    brew install qemu
    ```

3. Convert the `.vdmk` file to `.qcow2` (QEMU Image)
    >Fun Fact:
    >
    >VMDK: **V**irtual **M**achine **D**is**k**
    >
    >QCOW2: **Q**EMU **C**opy-**O**n-**W**rite version **2**


    ```sh
    qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 Metasploitable.vmdk Metasploitable.qcow2
    ```

4. Load the .QCOW2 file to UTM App

### Install Metasploitable 2 (on VirtualBox | Intel/AMD users)

This is installation might be a little tricky! but don't worry i got you covered. if we take a look inside the .zip file, we will see bunch of files. the most important one that we need to work with is `Metasploitable.vmdk`. `.vmdk` file is a Virtual Disk, meaning the metasploitable VM is already installed on it we just need to attach it and boot it up. here is how:

1. In our VirtualBox instead of clicking on Add we will press **New**. we can also do so from the top menu => Machine => New.
2. Choose a name for your VM. It's recommanded that you choose the same decompressed directory which includes `.vmdk` file. Choose the Type to be Linux and Subtype to be Other Linux.

    ![alt text](../images/lab1-fig5.png)

3. We will jump to the last section *Hard Disk*. Since we have the Disk ready we just need to find it and attach it to this VM instance that we are creating.

    ![alt text](../images/lab1-fig6.png)

4. Click on Add button to find and add the disk we talked about (`.vdmk` file). It will be added into *Not Attached* section at first. You need to select it and press *Choose*.

    ![alt text](../images/lab1-fig7.png)

5. Again we need to make sure the NAT is configured correctly. You need to configure it using the Metasploitable VM's Setting similar to how we configred in Kali VM.
6. Now, You can launch the Metasploitable VM and log into it.

    - **Note for Windows 11 Users using VirtualBox:**

    - You might face a **Kernel Panic** with Metasploitable 2; **If you did !** here are steps for workaround:
      - Turn off the MetaSploitable 2 VM machine
      - Run below commands in the PowerShell:

        ```powershell
        vboxmanage modifyvm <vm uuid or vm name> --acpi off
        vboxmanage modifyvm <vm uuid or vm name> --ioapic off
        ```

7. Login to the VM. username: `msfadmin`, password: `msfadmin`

## NMAP -  A Reconnaissance Tool

Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon. Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and service and operating system detection.

## Write-Up

**‚ö†Ô∏è When screenshoting a command, make sure texts are clear and your hostname you changed earlier is shown.**

Briefly Explain how you get to answer of questions below and include screenshots. Don't forget your first **Mission!**

- Q1: Find your Kali's and Metasploitable's IP Addresses.
  - Note: If you're getting the same IP as the Kali Linux machine you need to change the network to a NAT network
- Q2: Using NMAP Cheatsheet above try to scan the **Metasploitable VM's** **services** and their **software versions** running on open **ports**. We will operate this recon from our Kali machine.
  - Hint: If you cannot see any port open on this machine from the Kali machine double-check the NAT network
  - Please explain which command's flag you used and why?
- Q3: What's the use case and when we need to use `-Pn` probing option with nmap?

### üíª Mission 1 ‚Äì Infiltrate the Target

>A mysterious message is hidden deep inside the Metasploitable machine.
Slip in through the front door (you already have the keys), hunt it down, and bring back the exact flag text.

- üîç Clue: "The keeper left the **door unlocked**. Find the hidden note in their **quarters** ‚Äî search for a name that includes `flag`. The flag itself looks like this: `BCIT{ üö© }`. Capture the üö©."
