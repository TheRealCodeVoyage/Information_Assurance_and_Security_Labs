# Assignment 1 â€“ Keep Secrets Secret!

Note: This is an individual assignment 

Use `docker-compose` to create a WordPress stack: 

https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/official-documentation-samples/wordpress/ 


### Steps

1. Set-Up 
- Use the above tutorial to create your `docker-compose.yml`
- Take note of your `docker-compose` file, particularly the environment variables. 
- Run `docker-compose up -d` and then navigate to `localhost:80` to view your WordPress installation. 
- If you see WordPress configuration your setup is complete! (You don't need to continue further for this assignment) 

2. Explore 

- Bash into your running WordPress container. (You need to find the `id` of the container that's running the WordPress image first by docker ps) 

```sh
docker exec -it <container_id> bash 
```

- or alternatively, use docker desktop to get CLI access to the container and run `/bin/bash` Using bash, print off your environment variables.

Hint: `printenv` Manual page of `printenv` command

### Questions: 
1.	Include screenshots of:
- Your running docker containers (i.e., `docker ps`)
- Your running Wordpress application in your browser 
2.	As you've noticed we've put some credentials in the docker-compose file using environment variables. Imagine that this file ends up in source control. **What is the potential security risk**? 
3.	List **three good development practices** that **GitGaurdian** has suggested to avoid leaking credentials with this docker setup. 
4.	Go through this link https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/ and explain how we can use an environment file instead of exposing credentials in the `docker-compose` file given above? **(Provide code snippet and commands)**
