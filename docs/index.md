## Course Overview

In this course, students develop a hands-on understanding of the security challenges associated with information systems and typical network structures. Through labs, quizzes, and assignments, students will learn to identify security vulnerabilities, assess threats, and apply tools for system hardening, monitoring, and auditing.

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Recognize and address basic security threats
- Understand firewalls, gateways, and secure network design
- Detect and analyze network intrusions using log files
- Manage vulnerabilities in Windows and Linux operating systems
- Implement encryption and cryptography practices
- Conduct backup, recovery, and user auditing

## Labs Included

This repository hosts individual labs, each with a separate Markdown file. Labs will include setup instructions, detailed exercises, and practical scenarios for the following topics:

1. **Setup Kali and Metasploitable** - Basic setup and configuration
2. **Vulnerability Scanning** - Scanning networks for weaknesses
3. **Exploit DBs on Metasploitable** - Practical exploitation exercises
4. **Log Analysis** - Techniques for analyzing log files
5. **Cryptography** - Introduction to encryption
6. **Public Key Infrastructure** - Managing digital certificates
7. **Password Cracking** - Assessing password strength
8. **Manually Verifying X509 Certificate** - Certificate verification
9. **Firewall Exploration** - Firewall setup and management
10. **Sniffing and Spoofing** - Network packet analysis
11. **DNS Spoofing** - Understanding and mitigating DNS attacks

## Getting Started

To begin, please clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in each lab. You will need a laptop with VirtualBox and Docker, along with the required software (e.g., Kali Linux, Metasploit).
